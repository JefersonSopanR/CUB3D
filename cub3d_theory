Cosine and Sine in 2D Ray Casting:

cos(ray->angle) gives the horizontal component of the ray's movement:
Positive (> 0): Ray is moving to the right.
Negative (< 0): Ray is moving to the left.
  
sin(ray->angle) gives the vertical component of the ray's movement:
Positive (> 0): Ray is moving upward.
Negative (< 0): Ray is moving downward.

sin(ray->angle) > 0 means the ray is pointing down (toward the south).
sin(ray->angle) <= 0 means the ray is pointing up (toward the north).
cos(ray->angle) > 0 means the ray is pointing right (toward the east).
cos(ray->angle) <= 0 means the ray is pointing left (toward the west).
